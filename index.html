          Japan, island country lying off the east coast of Asia. 
          It consists of a great string of islands in a northeast-southwest arc that stretches 
          for approximately 2,400 km through the western North Pacific Ocean. 
          Nearly the entire land area is taken up by the country’s four main islands; from north 
          to south these are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, 
          and Kyushu. Honshu is the largest of the four, 
          followed in size by Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. 
          In addition, there are numerous smaller islands, the major groups of which are the Ryukyu
          Islands to the south and west of Kyushu 
          and the Izu, Bonin, and Volcano 
          islands to the south and east of central Honshu. 
          The national capital, Tokyo, 
        in east-central Honshu, is one of the world’s most populous cities.
        <br><br>
        The Japanese landscape is rugged, with more than four-fifths of the land surface consisting 
        of mountains. There are many active and dormant volcanoes, 
        including Mount Fuji, which, at an elevation of 3,776 metres, 
        is Japan’s highest mountain. Abundant precipitation and the generally mild temperatures 
        throughout most of the country have produced a lush vegetation cover and, despite the 
        mountainous terrain and generally poor soils, have made it possible to raise a variety of crops. 
        Japan has a large and, to a great extent, ethnically homogeneous population, which is heavily 
        concentrated in the low-lying areas along the Pacific coast of Honshu.
        <br><br>
        The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. 
        The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters 
        and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop 
        deep snowbanks in the winter.
        <br><br>
        In the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy 
        snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot 
        temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid 
        continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. 
        The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal 
        winds, bringing mild weather year-round.

        The name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji 日本 and 
        is pronounced Nippon or Nihon. Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th century, the country 
        was known in China as Wa and in Japan by the endonym Yamato. 
        Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, 
        including on banknotes and postage stamps. Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and 
        reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. 
        The characters 日本 mean "sun origin", which is the source of the popular Western 
        epithet "Land of the Rising Sun".
        <br><br>
        The name "Japan" is based on Chinese pronunciations of 日本 and was introduced to European 
        languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin 
        or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters 日本國 as Cipangu. The old Malay name 
        for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and 
        encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in 
        the early 16th century. The first version of the name in English appears in a book 
        published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese 
        letter.

        People first came to Japan about 30,000 years ago. At the time, the main islands were 
        connected to Siberia and Korea by bridges of dry land, so people crossed on foot. 
        The first society, called the Jomon culture, arose about 12,000 years ago. 
        Around the same time, the Ainu people arrived by boat from Siberia.
        <br>
        The Jomon and Ainu survived for thousands of years, hunting, fishing, and gathering plants. 
        In 300 B.C., the Yayoi people came to Honshu Island from Korea and China. 
        They were skilled weavers, tool makers, and farmers who began cultivating rice in flooded 
        paddy fields.
        <br><br>
        In 660 B.C., Japan's first emperor, Jimmu Tenno, came to power. 
        Emperors controlled Japan until the 12th century A.D., when military rulers, called shoguns, 
        took control and ruled by might.
        <br><br>
        Europeans first arrived in Japan in 1543, bringing guns and Christianity. 
        In 1635, the ruling shogun closed Japan to foreigners and forbade Japanese to travel abroad. 
        This isolation lasted more than 200 years. In 1868, the shoguns were overthrown and emperors 
        returned. This was a time of great change and modernization for Japan.
        <br><br>
        During World War I (1914-1917), Japan fought on the side of the U.S. But on December 7, 1941, 
        Japan bombed the United States navy fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and the U.S. entered 
        World War II. From 1941-1945, Japan's military leaders fought against the U.S. and the allied 
        forces. In August 1945, the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and 
        Nagasaki, killing about 115,000 people. Japan surrendered a few days later.
