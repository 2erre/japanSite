                JAPAN RAIL PASS, a joint offering of the six companies comprising the Japan Railways 
            Group (JR Group), is the economical and convenient means of traveling throughout 
            Japan by rail.
            <br><br>
            There are two types of PASSes: PASS for Green Cars and PASS for Standard Cars. 
            Each type can be purchased for 7 days, 14 days or 21 days.
            <br><br>
            Before buying JAPAN RAIL PASS, carefully check the following to make sure you meet the 
            eligibility requirements!
            <br><br>
            The JAPAN RAIL PASS is a special fare ticket that is available only to travelers visiting 
            Japan from foreign countries for sightseeing. To be eligible to purchase a JAPAN RAIL PASS, 
            you must meet one of the following two conditions. Even if you have purchased a PASS online 
            or have an Exchange Order, if you do not meet the qualifications for using the JAPAN RAIL 
            PASS, you will be unable to pick it up or exchange it. Please confirm the usage 
            qualifications thoroughly prior to purchasing a PASS or Exchange Order.
            Also, if you do not meet the usage qualifications due to factors such 
            as insufficient documentation (including due to insufficient or incorrect 
            instructions from the travel agency where you purchased your Exchange Order) 
            and you are unable to receive a PASS, the JR Group takes no responsibility for any 
            transportation expenses incurred during your stay in Japan as a result. 
            Please confirm that you have all of the required confirmation documents prior to 
            leaving your country.
